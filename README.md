## Usage

Please refer to Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) to get started.

Once Helm is set up properly, add the repo as follows:

```console
helm repo add crowdsec https://crowdsecurity.github.io/helm-charts
```

You can then run `helm search repo crowdsec` to see the charts.

<!-- Keep full URL links to repo files because this README syncs from main to gh-pages.  -->
