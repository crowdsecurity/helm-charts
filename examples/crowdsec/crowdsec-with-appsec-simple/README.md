# Crowdsec WAF in kubernetes cluster

In this example, we will demonstrate how to set up Crowdsec Web Application Firewall (WAF) in a Kubernetes cluster to protect a vulnerable Wordpress installation with the in-band rules. We will also show how to write a custom rule to block specific attack vectors or specific use-cases, such as requests to the `xmlrpc.php` file in Wordpress. By the end of this guide, you will have a better understanding of how to leverage Crowdsec to enhance the security of your Kubernetes applications.

## Pre-requisites

- Working kubernetes cluster (tested on minikube)
- Ingress Nginx controller installed
- Helm installed

## Wordpress installation

```
helm install wordpress oci://registry-1.docker.io/bitnamicharts/wordpress -f wp-values.yaml
```

## Install Wordpress vulnerable plugin to CVE-2024-1071

Let get a shell in the wordpress pod and install the vulnerable plugin.

```
kubectl exec -it wordpress-7797f4d564-zp6rd -- bash
```

Then install the plugin
```
wp plugin install ultimate-member --version="2.8.2"
```

Enable the plugin in wordpress admin panel and activate the "Misc"=>"Enable custom table for usermeta" in the plugin settings.

Then use nuclei with the [following template](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates/blob/4809e136ac46259452b7167c24e65e453c856b7c/http/cves/2024/CVE-2024-1071.yaml).

```
$ nuclei -u http://mywp.local:31669 -t /tmp/CVE-2024-1071.yaml

```

Nuclei will return a critical vulnerability on the target.

## Crowdsec Installation

```
helm install crowdsec crowdsec/crowdsec -f crowdsec-values.yaml
```

check if all pods are running


## Setup Ingress nginx with crowdsec

patch the ingress to add crowdsec plugin
    
```
helm upgrade -n ingress-nginx ingress-nginx ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx -f ingress-nginx-values.yaml
```

## Retest the vulnerability

Thanks to the crowdsec WAF, and to the [in-band rule](https://app.crowdsec.net/hub/author/crowdsecurity/appsec-rules/vpatch-CVE-2024-1071) that blocks requests to the vulnerable endpoint, the request will be blocked. This rule is part of the [appsec-wordpress collection](https://app.crowdsec.net/hub/author/crowdsecurity/collections/appsec-wordpress) we installed earlier in the `crowdsec-values.yaml` file.

```
$ nuclei -u http://mywp.local:31669 -t /tmp/CVE-2024-1071.yaml --debug

Nuclei will receive a 403 error from the server, and the request will be blocked by crowdsec.

We demonstrate how the crowdsec WAF can block a critical vulnerability using virtual patching thanks to in-band rules from the crowdsec hub.
Now, we will see how to write a custom rule for a specific use case. Our example is the xmlrpc.php file in wordpress. This file is often used in brute force attacks. If users forgot to disable it, it can be a security risk. We will write a custom rule to block requests to this file.

## Write a custom rule

Following the [documentation](https://docs.crowdsec.net/docs/next/appsec/rules_syntax/), we will write a rule to block requests to xmlrpc.php.

```yaml
name: crowdsecurity/vpatch-xmlrpc
debug: true
description: "Block XMLRPC requests"
rules:
  - and:
    - zones:
        - METHOD
      match:
        type: equals
        value: POST
    - zones:
        - URI
      transform:
        - lowercase
      match:
        type: endsWith
        value: xmlrpc.php
labels:
  type: exploit
  service: http
  behavior: "http:exploit"
  label: "Block XMLRPC requests"
```

This rule will block any POST request to any URI ending with xmlrpc.php.

Now lets add this rule to crowdsec values and upgrade the helm chart.

```yaml
# upgrade-crowdsec-values.yaml
appsec:
  rules:
    mycustom-appsec-rule.yaml: |
      name: crowdsecurity/vpatch-xmlrpc
      debug: true
      description: "Block XMLRPC requests"
      rules:
        - and:
          - zones:
              - METHOD
            match:
              type: equals
              value: POST
          - zones:
              - URI
            transform:
              - lowercase
            match:
              type: endsWith
              value: xmlrpc.php
      labels:
        type: exploit
        service: http
        behavior: "http:exploit"
        label: "Block XMLRPC requests"
```

Then upgrade the helm chart

```
helm upgrade -n crowdsec crowdsec crowdsec/crowdsec -f crowdsec-values.yaml -f upgrade-crowdsec-values.yaml
```

Now, we will test the rule by sending a POST request to xmlrpc.php.

```
$ curl -XPOST http://mywp.local:31669/blog/xmlrpc.php | head
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
  0     0    0     0    0     0      0      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--     0<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>CrowdSec Ban</title>
    <meta content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
```

The request is blocked by crowdsec, and we receive a 403 error.
